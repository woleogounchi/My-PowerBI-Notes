# My-PowerBI-Notes
  Those are my notes on learning PowerBI.

## What is PowerBI?
  PowerBI is a Microsoft data visualization and analytics platform that allows to interactively explore data to gain insights.
  it enables you to effectively report insights through easy-to-use customizable visualizations.

## Transforming Data
  Raw data usually does not arrive in the perfect form when accounting for things like human errors, bugs, and file conversion. Power BI accounts for this with the Power Query Editor which allows to transform data before loading them.
